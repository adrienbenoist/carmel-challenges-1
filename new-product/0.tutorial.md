Let's create a brand new product. This is going to be really easy.

First off, create a brand new folder. Like so:

```
mkdir MyProduct
```

Great, now go into that new folder:

```
cd MyProduct
```

And let's tell Chunky to create a brand new product here:

```  
chunky init
```

That's all there is to it. See, that wasn't so hard :)
