Look up the ```assets``` folder and open it up.

Inside this file, look for the **{{route.cover.image}} file**.

Next, simply replace this file with another one. Make sure the image dimensions are roughly the same. It would be great if you add an image with approximate dimensions of **2048x1024** pixels.

*If the image is too small, it will not look good on large screens.*
