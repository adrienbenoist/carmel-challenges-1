## Change a cover subtitle

Look up the ```chunks/{{chunk.name}}/chunk.json``` file once again open it up. Inside this file, look once again for the **{{route}} route** element. Remember, it should look something like this:

```  
"routes": {
  "{{route}}": {
    ...
  }
}
```

Now, find the **cover** element again, within the **{{route}} route**. Here's how it should look:

```  
"routes": {
  "{{route}}": {
    "cover": {
      ...
    }
    ...
  }
}
```

Alright, now simply set the value of the **cover subtitle** to:

 ```
 "{{subtitle}}"
 ```
