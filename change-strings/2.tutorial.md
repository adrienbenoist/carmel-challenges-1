## Change a cover subtitle

Look up the ```chunks/intro/chunk.json``` file again. And this time, look for the **cover** element again. Remember, it should looks like this:

```
"cover": {
  ....
}
```   

And within that **cover**, now look for the **subtitle** element. It should look like this:

```
"cover": {
  "subtitle": ...
  ....
}
```   

Alright, now change the **cover subtitle** to:

 ```
 "{{subtitle}}"
 ```
