## Change a cover title

Look up the ```chunks/intro/chunk.json``` file again. This time, look for the **cover** element, that looks like this:

```
"cover": {
  ....
}
```   

And within that **cover**, now look for the **title** element. It should look like this:

```
"cover": {
  "title": ...
  ....
}
```   

Alright, now change the **cover title** to:

 ```
 "{{title}}"
 ```
