# Change a cover title

 Look up the ```chunks/{{chunk.name}}/chunk.json``` file once again open it up. Inside this file, look once again for the **{{route}} route** element. Remember, it should look something like this:

 ```  
 "routes": {
   "{{route}}": {
     ...
   }
 }
 ```

 Now, find the **cover** element within the **{{route}} route**. Here's how it should look:

 ```  
 "routes": {
   "{{route}}": {
     "cover": {
       ...
     }
     ...
   }
 }
 ```

Great, then simply set the value of the **cover title** to:

  ```
  "{{title}}"
  ```
