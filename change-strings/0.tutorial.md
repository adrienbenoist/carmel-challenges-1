# Change a page title

Look up the ```chunks/{{chunk.name}}/chunk.json``` file and open it up. Inside this file, look for the **{{route}} route** element. It should look something like this:

```  
"routes": {
  "{{route}}": {
    ...
  }
}
```

Next, find the **title** element, which should look like this:

```  
"routes": {
  "{{route}}": {
    "title": ...
    ...
  }
}
```

Then simply set the value of the **title** to:

 ```
 "{{title}}"
 ```
